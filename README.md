## The World of "The Legacy of the Runes"

There are no legends about the impact.

Only reports.

A foreign meteor tore through the sky.  
No omen. No chorus of prophets.  
Just a light that fell too fast.

With it, something unseen was ripped apart.  
A veil no one knew existed —  
until it was gone.

What remained were fragments.

Runes.

They make no promises.  
They offer no comfort.  
They function.

Magic here is not a miracle.  
It is application.  
Calculation.  
Consequence.

Without runes, there is no power.  
Without power, you do not survive long.

### The Rift

The impact did not open a war.

It opened a breach.

Something came through.

Not as an army.  
Not as demons from old stories.  
But as a consequence.

Some of them kill.  
Some observe.  
Some move with a purpose no one here understands.

They follow their own laws.  
And those laws have no interest in morality.

When they die, something remains.  
Crystallized energy.  
Rune fragments.

Power you can pick up.  
Power you can use.

Power you do not fully understand.

### The Anchor

You were never part of a plan.

A shard struck you.  
It should have killed you.

It did not.

Since then, you die —  
and remain.

The shard reconstructs you.  
It forces your existence back into shape.  
It binds you to the rift like a nail in rotting wood.

You are not chosen.  
No one called you.

You are an anomaly.

A fixed point where something holds.

Perhaps to keep the world from falling apart.  
Perhaps to ensure that it does.

---

### Death Is Routine

When your body fails, nothing ends.

No light.  
No peace.  
No voice.

Only reconstruction.

The world rearranges itself around you.  
Not out of mercy.  
Not out of justice.

But because you are required.

Or because you are required — until you are not.

### Runes Change More Than Steel

Runes are finite.

And every rune you bind shifts something.

Not only in your weapon.  
Not only in your flesh.

In your perception.

With each decision, it becomes clearer  
that power does not remain neutral.

You are looking for answers.

Why can you not die?  
Why are you bound?  
Are you stabilizing the rift — or are you the fracture?

And if you could close the veil —

Would you?

Or have you already begun to need the breach?

---

"The Legacy of the Runes" is not a story about heroes.

It is a story about binding.  
About consequence.  
And about the quiet realization  
that some things do not want to be repaired.
